*Risk Factors of Leaving the Bank:*
- Whether they have more than 2 products, followed by their activity. â€¨
- Lower credit score indicates higher leaving risk. 
- Older customers tend to leave due to changing needs.
- If a client is female and whether or not they reside in Germany. 


### Recommendations

- Pig E. Bank should consider re-engaging with inactive bank customers before they make a permanent decision to discontinue their services.
  Providing suitable discounts and rewards could be an effective approach.
- Priority in customer service efforts should be given to the German market, which experiences the highest percentage of customer attrition for Pig E. Bank.
- Former clients could be reconnecting with special offers from Pig E. Bank.
- Conducting additional research is necessary to understand why female customers tend to leave the bank more frequently than their male counterparts.
